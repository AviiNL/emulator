### This Project still needs a name

It's an x86 emulater in TypeScript based off [v86 by copy](https://github.com/copy/v86)

### Why?
Mainly for educational purposes

### Why transpile to es6?
To get `this.constructor.name` to work. if you know how to get this value in es5, let me know

### What's what
- Components are directly attached to the mainboard (chips/memory etc)
- Devices are connected via wires/cables (from harddisks and cdroms to keyboard and screens)

### Who?
- [copy](https://github.com/copy) for the inspiration
- [AviiNL](https://github.com/aviinl) (me)
